Welcome to my Pandas tutorial. This is designed to be used with the attached PDF, and the python files contain the problems for the lesson. This course aims to act as a primer to basic Pandas usage. 

The slideshow is [here:](Pandas%20Course.pdf).

Documentation for pandas can be found at https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/, or alternatively some basic documentation can be found under notebooks/10-minutes-to-pandas.ipynb.

test.csv is a sample data set.
